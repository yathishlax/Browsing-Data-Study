BROWSING DATA:

The data presented us with browsing activity of various customers and the purchase information of customers.
It was as follows:
Conversions dataset contains the details of the customers to finally purchased from the site
•	Timestamp: Order purchase timestamp
•	user_id: unique identifier of the customer
•	product_id: unique identifier of the product purchased
•	cart_value: total cart value
Browsing Behaviour dataset contains the overall browing in a particular day
•	timestamp: time of the day
•	user_id: unique identifier of customer
•	browsing_url: website sections visited by the customer

The goal of this project is to observe the browsing activity of the customers and thus predict if these activity will convert into purchases.
1.	How to utilize the finding?
•	Based on the various inferences made we can make educated decisions to increase our profit and decrease cost and resources.
•	The model helps us to predict which of the potential customers that are browsing the products are likely to convert in to actual customers and make purchases. We can hence focus on these customers and spend our efforts in to retaining them.
